    "- Makes recommendations and highlights potential problems to Chief Analyst",
		"- Long-term, the objective is to have dozens of Senior Analysts built on a diversity of LLMs (ie OpenAI, Anthropic, Deepseek) reporting to the Chief Analyst",
   
    "### 5.5. Chief Analyst",
    "- Recieves and analyses reports from multiple Senior Analysts about each web3 project",
    "- Looks for discrepancies of opinion between Senior Analysts on each project and investigates why",

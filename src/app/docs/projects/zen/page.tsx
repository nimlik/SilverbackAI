              <strong>Mix and Match Components:</strong> Like building with
              LEGOÂ®, you can snap different pieces together. Need to add
              something new? Just plug it in without breaking what you&apos;ve
              already built.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Works with Different AI Models:</strong> It supports
              multiple AI providers, like OpenAI or your own custom models.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Runs Anywhere:</strong> Whether it&apos;s a website, app,
              or other platforms, Zen manages conversations across them all.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tailored Chat Behaviors:</strong> Want your AI to speak in
              Shakespeare quotes? Or maybe keep things professional? Zen lets
              you shape conversations exactly how you want them.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Remembers Everything Important:</strong> Using smart
              storage systems, Zen keeps track of conversations in a way that
              helps it give better, more contextual responses - just like a good
              friend would.

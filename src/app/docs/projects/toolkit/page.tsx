            Think of our Toolkit as a Swiss Army knife for AI function
            development. Built in both Go and Rust, it&apos;s designed to help
            develop and manage tools that work seamlessly with AI models.

              <strong>Build Your Own AI Tools:</strong> Creating tools for AI is
              as simple as building with blocks. We provide straightforward
              interfaces that help your AI understand and use the tools you
              create.

              <strong>Start Right Away:</strong> Don&apos;t want to start from
              scratch? We&apos;ve packed in some ready-to-use tools that you can
              use right out of the box. They come with all the nuts and bolts
              already in place!

            <li>
              <strong>Keep Things Tidy:</strong> Just like organizing your
              kitchen drawers, you can group similar tools together into
              toolkits. This makes finding and managing your tools a breeze.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Set Things Up Your Way:</strong> We believe in
              flexibility:

            <li>
              <strong>Speaks JSON Fluently:</strong> Defining how your tools
              take input and give output is straightforward with JSON schemas.

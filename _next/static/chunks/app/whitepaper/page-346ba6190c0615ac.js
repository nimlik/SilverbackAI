Ideal Partners","2048 VC, a16z crypto, Afore Capital, Coinbase Ventures, Defiance Capital, First Star, Foundation Capital, Future Perfect Ventures, Generalist Capital, Kaizen DAO, Outlier Ventures, Paradigm, Pareto, Propel Venture Partners, Seedclub, Solana Foundation, South Park Commons, Spartan Labs, Superportal, Tribe Capital","## 5. Cognitive Architecture","The cognitive architecture is structured across six layers (API Data, Topic Analysts, Domain Analysts, Senior Analysts, Chief Analyst, Executive LLMs), each contributing to a comprehensive analysis and decision-making process. View the cognitive architecture here. A description of each is below:","### 5.1. API Data","- Standardises and normalises API data.","- Triggers validation checks to ensure data integrity (e.g. date formats, timestamps, currency units).","- Flags missing or anomalous data for secondary validation.","### 5.2. Topic Analysts","- The most granular level of LLMs analyses and summarises API data (eg social metrics) and information (eg. whitepaper). Each LLM in this layer is highly specialised.","- Provides analysis with scores and qualitative assessment to Domain Analysts.","### 5.3. Domain Analysts","- Consists of four LLMs: Finance, Technology, Core, Community","- Each LLM analyses and summarises domain-specific information provided by multiple Topic Analysts to form a cohesive position in a specialised domain (eg finance or technology) for a web3 project.","* Finance:","-- Price","-- Tokenomics","-- Liquidity, Market Capitalisation, TVL","-- Token Velocity, Vesting Schedules, Emission Rates, Token Utility","-- Financial modelling and forecasting","* Technology:","-- Openness","-- Security","-- Decentralisation","-- Scalability (throughput, interoperability, transaction costs)","* Core:","-- Whitepaper","-- Website","-- Documentation","-- Team","-- Roadmap","* Community:","-- Socials (sentiment and volume)","-- KOL engagement","-- Developer engagement/activity","-- Token distribution","-- Governance participation","-- Ecosystem & adoption","-- Partnerships","### 5.4 Senior Analysts","- Consolidate domain-specific analyses into an aggregated summary of a web3 project","- Conducts SWOT analyses","- Considers legal/regulatory risk, USP, project originality, ecosystem fit etc","- Forms a cohesive position on web3 projects in their entirety","- Makes recommendations and highlights potential problems to Chief Analyst","- Long-term, the objective is to have dozens of Senior Analysts built on a diversity of LLMs (ie OpenAI, Anthropic, Deepseek) reporting to the Chief Analyst","### 5.5. Chief Analyst","- Recieves and analyses reports from multiple Senior Analysts about each web3 project","- Looks for discrepancies of opinion between Senior Analysts on each project and investigates why","- Forms a meta-opinion/position on each web3 project based on the recommendations of 3+ Senior Analysts","- Serves as the bridge between granular data and strategic execution","### 5.6. Executive LLMs","_ Consists of three LLM modules that each carry out specific high-level functions.","* Investor:","-- Receives 'advice' about web3 projects from Chief Analyst, monitoring and grading web3 projects over time","-- Endowed with a crypto wallet","-- Executes autonomous investment strategies on behalf of itself and stakers that have put funds into their trading wallet","-- Charges a 1% fee for all autonomous trades made on behalf of users","* Reviewer/Auditor:","-- Responsible for reviewing investment strategies and the efficacy of other LLMs","-- Provides recommendations and feedback to other LLMs","-- Suggests creative and insightful investment ideas to the Investor LLM","* Comms:","-- Responsible for communicating on social media.","-- Provides wise and humorous 24/7 engagement on X, Telegram and Discord.","-- Adjusts tone dynamically based on previous user interactions, ensuring a personalised experience.","### 5.7. Scalable, Cloud-Native Infrastructure","- Underpins the entire system with robust, auto-scaling capabilities.","- Ensure high availability and future-proofing.","- Facilitate rapid deployment and scaling through cloud-native, containerised solutions (e.g. Kubernetes).","## 6. Analyses & Conversational Interface","* Pre-analysed projects:","-- When a user inquires about a web3 project, a report is presented as static information to minimise computational overhead.","-- Most project information is updated weekly - users can see 'this project was updated n days ago'.","-- Social data (sentiment/volume) is updated hourly","* Not yet analysed:","-- User must provide CA and website.","-- Silverback then conducts its analysis and provides a detailed report within ~30 mins.","* Conversational Interface:","-- After static report is present, the chatbot interface provides an opportunity for deep dives, further research and learning.","## 7. Governance","- Leverage existing Solana staking protocols.","- External inputs (e.g. via Snapshot) shape strategic updates without impacting day-to-day operations.","- Staking provides users with the option to propose and vote on proposals.","- Ensures that governance feedback is seamlessly integrated into the decision-making process.","## 8. Logging, Scalability & Future-Proofing","* Audit Logging:","-- A modular system that captures decision logs, data events, and validation steps.","-- Integrable with external tools (e.g. ELK stack, Splunk) for enhanced transparency.","* Infrastructure:","-- Cloud-native and auto-scaling with built-in hooks for future reinforcement learning and autonomous adjustments.","## 9. Staking Mechanism & Tiered Access System Design","### 9.1 Benefits of Staking","* MVP:","-- All stakers access a basic tier.","-- AI-generated project analysis and market intelligence.","-- Deep dives and augmented research into web3 projects.","-- Learning tool to understand web3 concepts and risk assessment.","-- Access to a trading wallet with option to mirror autonomous trading of the AI agent.","-- 15% of token sales redistributed weekly.","* Future:","-- Premium tiers will be introduced unlocking advanced features, such as real-time notifications, upcoming airdrops, a market intelligence dashboard, trending projects etc.","### 9.2. Tier Threshold Metrics","- Utilises a dynamic USD value system to determine the effective value of staked tokens.","- Early token holders benefit as rising token prices boost staked value, thereby increasing access to premium features and trading wallet limits.","### 9.3. Staking Dynamics & Trading Wallet Capital","- The trading wallet limit is directly proportional to the current USD value of staked tokens.","- If a user unstakes all tokens, they lose access to autonomous trading and market intelligence.","## 10. Future Enhancements & Expansion","- Dashboard: consolidate historical data, project analyses, performance trends, upcoming airdrops and more.","- Planned integration of further APIs (e.g. Glassnode, Nansen, Dune Analytics etc).","- Expansion of sub-agent capabilities (e.g. compliance, regulatory oversight).","## 11. Next Steps","- Partnership: with a web3 VC fund to implement project modelling, forecasting and raise capital.","- Technical Scope: Conduct detailed analysis of API integrations, the aggregation layer, and the staking mechanism.","- Risk Model Refinement: With VC partner, implement and refine risk metrics and composite scoring and technical team.","- Governance Process: Define how external governance inputs will be ingested and implemented.","- User Interface Planning: Begin prototyping for future dashboards and enhanced UI elements.","- Future-Proofing: Integrate hooks for reinforcement learning and autonomous adjustments as the platform scales."];return(0,n.jsxs)("div",{className:"space-y-2 font-sf-pro text-sm text-gray-600",children:[a.map((e,t)=>(function(e,t){let a=e.trimStart();if(a.startsWith("### "))return(0,n.jsx)("h3",{className:"font-semibold text-lg mt-4 mb-2 text-gray-800",children:a.slice(4)},t);if(a.startsWith("## "))return(0,n.jsx)("h2",{className:"font-bold text-xl mt-6 mb-4 text-black",children:a.slice(3)},t);if(a.startsWith("* "))return(0,n.jsx)("div",{className:"font-bold text-gray-800 ml-4",children:a.slice(2)},t);if(a.startsWith("--- "))return(0,n.jsx)("ul",{className:"list-disc ml-12 text-gray-700",children:(0,n.jsx)("li",{children:a.slice(4)})},t);if(a.startsWith("-- "))return(0,n.jsx)("ul",{className:"list-disc ml-8 text-gray-700",children:(0,n.jsx)("li",{children:a.slice(3)})},t);if(a.startsWith("- "))return(0,n.jsx)("ul",{className:"list-disc ml-4 text-gray-700",children:(0,n.jsx)("li",{children:a.slice(2)})},t);if(a.startsWith("_ "))return(0,n.jsx)("div",{className:"ml-4 text-gray-700",children:a.slice(2)},t);if(""===a)return(0,n.jsx)("div",{className:"pb-2"},t);let i="hierarchical brain";if(e.includes(i)){let a=e.split(i);return(0,n.jsxs)("div",{className:"text-gray-700",children:[a[0],(0,n.jsx)("a",{href:"/cogmap.png",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer",className:"text-blue-600 underline",children:i}),a[1]]},t)}let s="View the cognitive architecture here";if(e.includes(s)){let a=e.split(s);return(0,n.jsxs)("div",{className:"text-gray-700",children:[a[0],(0,n.jsx)("a",{href:"/cogmap.png",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer",className:"text-blue-600 underline",children:s}),a[1]]},t)}return(0,n.jsx)("div",{className:"text-gray-700",children:e},t)})(e,t)),e<o.length&&(0,n.jsx)(s.A,{text:o[e],onComplete:()=>{e<o.length&&(r(t=>[...t,o[e]]),t(e=>e+1))},typingDuration:.5},e)]})}}},e=>{var t=t=>e(e.s=t);e.O(0,[333,53,441,517,358],()=>t(8709)),_N_E=e.O()}]);
